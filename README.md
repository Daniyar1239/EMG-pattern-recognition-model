# EMG-pattern-recognition-model
This code is for the design of a bionic/myoelectric prosthesis based on the Pattern Recognition (PR) control scheme.

The PR model involves three major stages like signal preprocessing (e.g., denoising), feature engineering (feature extraction & selection), and signal classification based on Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL) algorithms.

This project is ongoing, having been completed the first two steps with the last step (classifcation) being in process of realization. The ML model design will be possibly performed in Python.

The database for this project was taken from the NinaPro website: http://ninapro.hevs.ch/node/17. More concretely, the NinaPro DB2 and DB3 will be used in this project.

The final aim of this project is to develop a model, which is able to distinguish the EMG signals based on their features and classify them into corresponding hand motions.

Please, see the presentation attached to this repository to grasp the important details of this project.

Good luck!
